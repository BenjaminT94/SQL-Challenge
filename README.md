This is a short and sweet SQL challenge that I was assigned after learning basic and advanced SQL queries in one week.
Concepts covered in this assignment were: Making ERDs, understanding and applying one-to-one and one-to-many connections in an ERD, using basic operators such as WHERE and LIKE in a query, and joining multiple tables for a query.
